## Project Discussion Log
**Project**: P2P Zoom-like Application Development
**Started**: September 20, 2025

## Session 1: Project Documentation Setup

### User Request
- Read the plan markdown file and implement documentation structure
- Follow specific guidelines for project organization and documentation

### Initial Assessment
**Files Found:**
- `PLAN.md` - Comprehensive roadmap for P2P Zoom-like app
- `README.md` - Basic project stub

**Project Scope Identified:**
- Build P2P video calling application using Node.js + WebRTC
- 8-phase development approach from basic CRUD to 4-user mesh calls
- Technology stack: Node.js, Express, Socket.IO, WebRTC, vanilla JS frontend

### Decisions Made

#### Documentation Structure
1. **README-todo.md**: Created comprehensive task tracking with all 8 phases broken down
   - ✅ Organized by phase with checkboxes for progress tracking
   - ✅ Included next steps and notes section
   - ✅ Structured for ongoing updates as phases complete

2. **readme-architecture.md**: Created detailed system architecture documentation
   - ✅ High-level architecture diagrams (ASCII art)
   - ✅ Component breakdown (backend/frontend)
   - ✅ Data flow documentation
   - ✅ Design rationale and technology choices
   - ✅ Scalability considerations and future enhancements

3. **conversation.md**: This file for logging decisions and discussions

#### Key Architectural Insights Documented
- **Full-mesh topology**: Suitable for 4 users, direct P2P connections
- **Perfect negotiation pattern**: Avoids WebRTC "glare" conflicts
- **Incremental complexity**: Start simple, add features progressively
- **Socket.IO signaling**: Handles WebRTC coordination and room management

### Project State Assessment
**Current Phase**: Phase 0 (Setup) - Not yet started
**Next Immediate Steps**:
1. npm initialization and dependency installation
2. Basic folder structure creation
3. Server.js foundation setup

### Technical Decisions Logged

#### Why Node.js + Express?
- Rapid development with minimal boilerplate
- Consistent JavaScript across stack
- Socket.IO mature WebSocket handling
- Express industry standard for REST APIs

#### WebRTC Architecture Choice
- **P2P Mesh**: Direct connections, low latency, no media server costs
- **Limitation**: Bandwidth scales O(N-1), suitable for small groups only
- **Future**: Can upgrade to SFU/MCU for larger groups

#### Development Philosophy
- **Test each phase**: Complete validation before proceeding
- **Minimal viable**: Start simple, add complexity incrementally
- **Error resilience**: Plan for connection failures and reconnection
- **Documentation**: Living documents updated with each phase

### Questions for Future Sessions
1. Should we begin Phase 0 setup immediately?
2. Any preference for specific STUN/TURN servers during development?
3. Authentication requirements - integrate with existing systems or standalone?
4. UI framework preference beyond vanilla JS (if any)?

### Action Items Completed
- ✅ Read and analyzed PLAN.md
- ✅ Created README-todo.md with comprehensive task breakdown
- ✅ Created readme-architecture.md with system design documentation
- ✅ Created conversation.md for ongoing discussion logging
- ✅ Assessed current project state and files

### Notes for Next Session
- Ready to begin Phase 0: npm init and dependency installation
- All documentation framework in place for tracking progress
- Architecture decisions documented for reference during development
- Consider creating commit after documentation setup is complete
